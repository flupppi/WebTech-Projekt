                <h1>About our Company </h1>
                <h5 class="w3-padding-32">
                    Yvon Chouinard, Patagonia's founder, got his start as a climber in 1953 as a 14-year-old
                    member of the Southern California Falconry Club, which trained hawks and falcons for
                    hunting. After one of the adult leaders, Don Prentice, taught the boys how to rappel down
                    the cliffs to the falcon aeries, Yvon and his friends became so fond of the sport they
                    started hopping freight trains to the west end of the San Fernando Valley, to the sandstone
                    cliffs of Stoney Point. There, eventually, they learned to climb up as well as rappel down
                    the rock.

                    Chouinard started hanging out at Stoney Point on every weekend in the winter, and at
                    Tahquitz Rock above Palm Springs in the fall and spring. There he met some other young
                    climbers who belonged to the Sierra Club, including TM Herbert, Royal Robbins, and Tom
                    Frost. Eventually, the friends moved on from Tahquitz to Yosemite, to teach themselves to
                    climb its big walls.

                    The only pitons available at that time were made of soft iron, placed once, then left in the
                    rock. But in Yosemite, multiday ascents required hundreds of placements. Chouinard, after
                    meeting John Salathé, a Swiss climber and Swedenborgian mystic who had once made hard-iron
                    pitons out of Model A axles, decided to make his own reusable hardware. In 1957, he went to
                    a junkyard and bought a used coal-fired forge, a 138-pound anvil, some tongs and hammers,
                    and started teaching himself how to blacksmith.

                    Chouinard made his first pitons from an old harvester blade and tried them out with T.M.
                    Herbert on early ascents of the Lost Arrow Chimney and the North Face of Sentinel Rock in
                    Yosemite. The word spread and soon friends had to have Chouinard's chrome-molybdenum steel
                    pitons. Before he knew it he was in business. He could forge two of his in an hour, and sold
                    them for $1.50 each.
                    <div class="w3-padding-16 w3-center">
                        <img style="max-width:100%" src="img/home-slider-slide-1.jpg">

                    </div>
                    Chouinard built a small shop in his parents' backyard in Burbank. Most of his tools were
                    portable, so he could load up his car and travel the California coast from Big Sur to San
                    Diego, surfing. After a session, he would haul his anvil down to the beach and cut out angle
                    pitons with a cold chisel and hammer before moving on.

                    For the next few years, Chouinard forged pitons during the winter months, spent April to
                    July on the walls of Yosemite, then headed out of the heat of summer for the high mountains
                    of Wyoming, Canada, or the Alps, and then back to Yosemite in the fall until the snow fell
                    in November. He supported himself selling gear from the back of his car. The profits were
                    slim, though. For weeks at a time, he'd live on fifty cents to a dollar a day. Before
                    leaving for the Rockies one summer he bought two cases of dented, canned cat tuna from a
                    damaged-can outlet in San Francisco. This food supply was supplemented by oatmeal, potatoes,
                    and poached ground squirrel and porcupines.

                    In Yosemite, Chouinard and his friends were called the Valley Cong. They had to hide out
                    from the rangers in the boulders above Camp 4 after they overstayed the 2-week camping
                    limit. They took pride in the fact that climbing rocks and icefalls had no economic value,
                    that they were rebels. Their heroes were Muir, Thoreau, Emerson, Gaston Rebuffat, Ricardo
                    Cassin, and Herman Buhl.</h5>

                <p class="w3-text-grey">
                    During the late sixties, men did not wear bright, colorful clothes, not outside. "Active
                    sportswear" consisted of basic gray sweatshirts and pants, and the standard issue for
                    climbing in Yosemite was tan cut-off chinos and white dress shirts bought from the thrift
                    store. On a winter climbing trip to Scotland in 1970, Chouinard bought a regulation team
                    rugby shirt to wear rock climbing.</p>

                <h1>Our Philosophy</h1>
                <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Patagonia was still a fairly small company when we started to devote time
                    and money to the
                    increasingly apparent environmental crisis. We all saw what was happening in the remote
                    corners of the world: creeping pollution and deforestation, the slow, then not so slow,
                    disappearance of fish and wildlife. And we saw what was happening closer to home: thousand
                    year-old Sequoias succumbing to L.A. smog, the thinning of life in tide pools and kelp beds,
                    the rampant development of the land along the coast.

                    What we began to read – about global warming, the cutting and burning of tropical forests,
                    the rapid loss of groundwater and topsoil, acid rain, the ruin of rivers and creeks from
                    silting-over dams – reinforced what we saw with our eyes and smelled with our noses during
                    our travels. At the same time, we slowly became aware that uphill battles fought by small,
                    dedicated groups of people to save patches of habitat could yield significant results.

                    The first lesson had come right here at home, in the early '70s. A group of us went to a
                    city council meeting to help protect a local surf break. We knew vaguely that the Ventura
                    River had once been a major steelhead salmon habitat. Then, during the forties, two dams
                    were built, and water diverted. Except for winter rains, the only water left at the river
                    mouth flowed from the sewage plant. At that city council meeting, several experts testified
                    that the river was dead and that channeling the mouth would have no effect on remaining
                    bird- and wildlife, or on our surf break.

                    Things looked grim until Mark Capelli, a 25-year-old biology student, gave a slide show of
                    photos he had taken along the river – of the birds that lived in the willows, of the
                    muskrats and water snakes, of eels that spawned in the estuary. He even showed a slide of a
                    steelhead smolt: yes, fifty or so steelhead still came to spawn in our "dead" river.

                    The development plan was defeated. We gave Mark office space and a mailbox, and small
                    contributions to help him fight the River's battle. As more development plans cropped up,
                    the Friends of the Ventura River worked to defeat them, to clean up the water and to
                    increase its flow. Wildlife increased and more steelhead began to spawn.

                    Mark taught us two important lessons: that a grassroots effort could make a difference, and
                    that degraded habitat could, with effort, be restored. His work inspired us. We began to
                    make regular donations, to stick to smaller groups working to save or restore habitat rather
                    than give the money to NGOs with big staffs, overheads, and corporate connections. In 1986,
                    we committed to donate 10% of profits each year to these groups. We later upped the ante to
                    1% of sales, or 10% of profits, whichever was greater. We have kept to that commitment every
                    year since.
                </h5>

                <p class="w3-text-grey">we initiated our first national
                    environmental campaign on behalf of an alternative master plan to deurbanize the
                    Yosemite Valley. Each year since, we have undertaken a major education campaign on an
                    environmental issue. We took an early position against globalization of trade where it
                    means compromise of environmental and labor standards. We have argued for dam removal
                    where silting, marginally useful dams compromise fish life. We have supported wildlands
                    projects that seek to preserve ecosystems whole and create corridors for wildlife to
                    roam. We hold, every eighteen months, a "Tools for Activists" conference to teach
                    marketing and publicity skills to some of the groups we work with.</p>
